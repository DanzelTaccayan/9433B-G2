Because We Care 
- Animal Cruelty is the intentional torture and neglegence of man towards animals.
Intentional acts of torture by man towards animals involves beating, spitting, inhumane butchering, and other 
unpleasant acts. On the other hand, the irresponsibility of man towards animals like leaving them out in the streets
being harassed by other people or letting them starve to death leads to the negligence of man towards animals.
Nevertheless, doing any kind of harm leads them to be in a state of trauma, pain, disability, and - in the worst case -
death. We at Animal Talks do not condone any violent acts towards animals. As an organization dedicated in caring animals,
we have the obligation to treat and protect animals from any kind of harassment. If you know anybody who is involved in 
violent acts towards animals, don't hesitate to contact your local law enforcement to handle such matters. 
Remember, "Do unto others what you want people do to you".

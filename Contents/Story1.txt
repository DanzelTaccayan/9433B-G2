I hated dogs before because I think that they are vicious animals 
who doesnt know their place in this world. I started to hate
dogs when we started moving to this place that was filled with many stray dogs.The stray dogs in our place would bite you instantly when they feel fear in you or if you run away from them without any reason but the main reason why I hated them so much was that I had this friend who had a dog which I thought was good but ended up not to be because that dog almost bit my chin off, since that day me and my friends would play with that dog and not in a good way, what I mean about this is that the game we played with the dog was that we would first tie him up with his dog chain and then we would place ourselves near him then one of us would remove the dog chain and everyone would run as fast as he can to a safe place that the dog can't reach but all of that changed when my cousin introduced me his dog which he loved and cared so much.He showed to me why he loved his dog very much and why dogs should be cared for, at first he invited me to walk the dog and I said no but he insisted so I was forced to say yes.After that I walked the dog and I noticed that the dog was very gentle to me when I run he would just run to me and then he would stay by my side when I would pet him he would not bite my hand instead he would just ignore it, and because of I realized that the attitude of a dog really depends on how you treat them or cared for them, so today I really love dogs because today what I thought was vicious became gentle and loving.
